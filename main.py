Play a game of snake !

I do not recommend it as it is in first person and not that fun
But if you want, you can

Train your own snakes !

Starts the genetic algorithm with parameters that I've already tested
Best snake of each generation is saved in current folder
The training speed depend a lot on your CPU and its cores number

Contact me if you know how to make it run on GPU
